# JavaScript Algorithms 

Those are my attempts to code some algorithms in JavaScript   
Newer from top, older from bottom   
Those solutions may not be perfect or even good - **I warn**

# Testing

Each **finished** algorithm have it's own folder which contains at least 3 files: 
- `solution.js`
- `solution.test.js` 
- `README.md`

To test solution with [Jest](https://jestjs.io) use command:
```
npm test <path-to-folder>
```

For example to run tests for `human-readable-duration-format` algorithm use the following command:
```
npm test /codewars/human-readable-duration-format
```
